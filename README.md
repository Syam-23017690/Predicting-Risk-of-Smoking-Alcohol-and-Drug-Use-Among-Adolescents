# Predicting-Risk-of-Smoking-Alcohol-and-Drug-Use-Among-Adolescents
This project focuses on understanding &amp; predicting substance use behaviors-smoking, alcohol, and drug use among adolescents in England. By combining demographic data (age, gender), school information (type, free school meals), and local socioeconomic factors (deprivation scores), the project explores the key factors that influence these behaviors.
Three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost—are applied to predict which young people are at higher risk. The project also examines patterns across schools and regions to provide actionable insights that can help inform public health strategies and early interventions.

The workflow includes cleaning and preparing multiple official datasets from NHS Digital, ONS, the Department for Education, and the Indices of Multiple Deprivation. Exploratory data analysis is performed to uncover trends and relationships, while feature importance analysis highlights the most influential risk factors. Clustering techniques are also used to group adolescents based on behavioral risk profiles, offering a deeper understanding of patterns.

Datasets Used:

NHS Youth Substance Use Data 2023

ONS Population Estimates

School Characteristics Data

Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2019

Goal:
The project aims to provide actionable insights into youth substance use, identify high-risk groups, and demonstrate how data science can be applied to tackle real-world public health challenges effectively.
